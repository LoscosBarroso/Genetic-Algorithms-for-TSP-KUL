Author: Daniel Loscos Barroso
Year: 2018

Description:

This code was written in MATLAB and uses the gatbx mainly for the GUI output. The goal was to create a GA Framework with plenty of parameters and tunning options to test against different TSP instances.
Template contains the code handed to us at the begining of the assignment. The file report.pdf contains information on the designing process and an analysis of the test results.

To start using it just copy src to your MTLAB folder, add gatbx to the PATH and run tspgui.m
